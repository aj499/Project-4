In March 2013, Africa was identified as the world's poorest inhabited continent; however, the World Bank expects that most African countries will reach "middle income" status (defined as at least US $1,000 per person a year) by 2025 if current growth rates continue. In 2013, Africa was the world’s fastest-growing continent at 5.6% a year, and GDP is expected to rise by an average of over 6% a year between 2013 and 2023. Growth has been present throughout the continent, with over one-third of Sub-Saharan African countries posting 6% or higher growth rates, and another 40% growing between 4% to 6% per year.

HIV/AIDS continues to devastate the WHO Africa Region, which has 11% of the world's population but 60% of the people with HIV/AIDS. Although HIV/AIDS remains the leading cause of death for adults, more and more people are receiving life-saving treatment. Also, more than 90% of the estimated 300–500 million malaria cases that occur worldwide every year are in Africans, mainly in children under five years of age, but most countries are moving towards better treatment policies.

The economies of South America vary greatly.  Some countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, that face the Atlantic Ocean, mistrust globalization and gives the state a large role in the economy. Others, that face the Pacific such as Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia, embrace free trade and free markets.  A risk is that commodity prices are falling and many of the economies depend on these for income.

Health varies between countries with some having government funded health systems and others struggling to improve health equity across their countries.  In many cases there is a large disparity between rural and urban areas.  Rural areas often lack access to water and sanitation while this is rarely a problem in the more industrialized areas.

The economy of North America is marked by a sharp division between the predominantly English speaking countries of Canada and the United States, which are among the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world, and countries of Central America and the Caribbean in the former Latin America that are less developed. Mexico and Caribbean nations of the Commonwealth of Nations are somehow between the economic extremes of the development of North America.

Despite EU/IMF rescue programs in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus, and fiscal consolidation measures in many other EU member states, significant risks to growth remain, including high public and private debt loads, crimped lending as banks raise capital, aging populations, onerous regulations, and high unemployment.  In September 2012 the European Central Bank indicated its willingness to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone member states that agree to a formal program of fiscal and structural reforms, aiming to reduce their borrowing costs and restore confidence in the eurozone. The eurozone has since made great strides towards a banking union to increase financial stability and improve lending conditions.

Healthcare in Europe is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidized) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance. All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a European Health Insurance Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.

Asia is the fastest growing economic region and the largest continental economy by GDP PPP in the world. China is the largest economy in Asia and the second largest economy in the world.  Asia, with the exception of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, is currently undergoing rapid growth and industrialization spearheaded by China and India, the two fastest growing major economies in the world. While East Asian and Southeast Asian countries generally rely on manufacturing and trade for growth, countries in the Middle East depend more on the production of commodities, principally oil, for economic growth. Over the years, with rapid economic growth and large trade surplus with the rest of the world, Asia has accumulated over US$4 trillion of foreign exchange reserves - more than half of the world's total.

Countries in Asia and the Pacific have reached unprecedented levels of prosperity, but millions of people are still mired in poverty and poor health, with no sign of their being able to breach the barrier to better medical care. Despite irrefutable evidence of this troubling gap between rich and poor, few governments and health specialists have access to the data they need to address the problem.

This region has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial market of Australia to the much less developed economies that belong to many of its island neighbours. New Zealand is the only other 1st world nation in the region, although the economy of Australia is by far the largest and most dominant economy in the region and one of the largest in the world.

The unemployment rate is very high and 60% of the country’s citizens are below age 24, so there needs to be job creation for the next generation.  Also, women are 3.5 times less literate than men and attend schooling, on average, for 4 years shorter.  Intervention, especially in the area of education and gender equality, is needed to increase productivity to potential.
There are several organizations that aim to help increase the availability of education to women.  An example is The Initiative to Educate Afghan Women. Their goal is to bring women to the United States for higher education opportunities so that they can contribute to the future of their country in a big way.  So far 80 girls have been able to participate in the program through donations and they all look to ignite change and speak out on the injustices they have witnessed.

The tragedy of the health emergency is that the most pervasive problems in Afghanistan have largely been controlled in other countries: chronic malnutrition and preventable diseases like diarrhea, respiratory infections, and measles. On top of these basic health threats Afghanistan is also saddled with an extensive network of landmines that kill or maim more civilians than in any other country.
HALO is an apolitical non-profit organization that works to clear the countryside in Afghanistan of mines and large caliber ammunition.  HALO’s humanitarian mine clearance project in Afghanistan is the oldest and largest in the world and has destroyed over 766,908 mines. Public donations allow them to purchase equipment and fund their program.  A donation of as little as $50 allows them to purchase necessary equipment to destroy a landmine and save a life.

Australia’s economy is very strong. Australia has benefited from a dramatic surge in its terms of trade in recent years, stemming from rising global commodity prices. Australia is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food. Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of coal, iron, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy sources.  A potential challenge comes from a decrease in demand for these commodities as growth of China and India slows.
Most of the potential challenges Australia faces economically will have to be solved by its government.  For example, Australia’s cost structure is high, exacerbated by the high currency. Australian minimum wages are around A$16 per hour, compared to around A$7-8 per hour in the US and A$1-2 per hour in China. The cost of Australian engineers is around $170 per hour, compared to $132 in the US, $129 in the UK or $77 in Japan.  Australia will have to develop policy to maintain its competitiveness.

Health care in Australia is provided by both private and government institutions. Medicare is the publicly funded universal health care scheme in Australia and was instituted in 1984. It coexists with a private health system. Life expectancy in Australia is among the highest in the world.  However, poor health of indigenous people and people in remote/rural areas still persists.  
Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet is a website that has compiled many organizations that aim to help the aboriginal people.  It also lists specific funding opportunities aimed at specific causes like cancer screening projects grants that can be helpful for those interested in starting projects aimed at helping the indigenous people.

Garment exports, the backbone of Bangladesh’s industrial sector and 80% of total exports, surpassed $21 billion last year, 18% of GDP. The sector has remained resilient in recent years amidst a series of factory accidents that have killed over 1,000 workers and crippling strikes that shut down virtually all economic activity.  One factory collapse, Rana Plaza, last year, killed over 400 people.
Protestors have gathered outside Walmart to demand that Walmart donate more money for the Rana Plaza collapse.  The Clean Clothes Campaign is an organization that plans memorial events and works to raise awareness of poor factory conditions worldwide.  They have drafted a letter that you can bring to a retailer near you who has yet to pay retribution to the families.  They also ask that anyone who wants to raise awareness retweet their tweets in memorium of the event so that more people will be aware of the hidden costs of fashion.

Bangladesh is the most densely populated large country in the world, with 150 million people living in a land area roughly the size of Iowa. As a result, poverty, lack of access to agricultural land, and poor eating habits contribute to one of the highest undernutrition rates in the world. Forty percent of the population currently lives below the poverty line and the country has one of the highest rates of child stunting in the world.
Organizations like Save the Children focus on improving the well being of communities that need help through donations and child sponsorship.  Child sponsorship allows you to make a lasting impact on a child’s life for less than $1 a day.  For $28 per month, you can provide for a child and their family in Bangladesh.  Save the Children wants donors to form a friendship with their child and will send you letters and pictures from your child that allow you to learn about their world.

Many Fortune 500 companies have specific programs in which employees can donate time to a specific cause they are interested in and in some cases get paid for that time.  An example is financial services firm, PwC’s “Project Belize” in which employees can travel to Belize and teach financial literacy and help to foster entrepreneurship in public schools and improve the social-economic situation.  If you’re interested in making a difference look out for programs like these when you begin to think about your ideal employer.

Belize is a coastal nation and thus is vulnerable to severe weather like hurricanes.  Disaster preparedness is not very strong and leaves citizens and food supplies vulnerable to the weather.  
The American Red Cross is helps Red Cross partners in Belize train staff, volunteers and community members in first aid, basic search and rescue, psychological first aid, response coordination and shelter management, and is undertaking disaster mitigation projects such as digging drainage ditches or installing straps that help secure roofs from the high winds of hurricanes.  Their programs are expected to benefit over 55,000 people in Belize.  The Red Cross takes donations and volunteers.  They are particularly effective with the capital they raise and an average of 91 cents of every dollar they spend is invested in humanitarian services and programs.

A drop in export prices, reduction of informal trade, and climate change have deeply affected the Bolivian economy in recent years. The outcome left the richest 10 percent of the Bolivian population earning 25 times more than the poorest 40 percent. Without education or access to financial services, the disparity between the rich and poor is not easily changed. Regulated institutions find it difficult to offer financial services due to the high costs involved.
The Foundation for Sustainable Development offers microfinance services and lending to poor citizens who institutions cannot lend to and who do not have access to credit.  They work with community partners in Bolivia to provide small business development courses in Food Services, Textiles, Furniture, Jewelry Work, Artisans, Leather and Metalwork and find funds for new businesses.  A donation of as little as $50 makes an impact and allows for the purchase of supplies for businesses which fosters self-empowerment.

However, in rural areas, access to safe drinking water is as low as 71% and sanitation coverage is as low as 10%.
Water for People is an organization that develops programs to address sanitation and water needs.  It works with local government, communities, schools, and private and civil society organizations to reach high levels of water and sanitation coverage.  Water for People has impact tours in which donors of at least $1000 can travel to the areas they are helping for one week to see exactly what is being done for the situation.  They also work closely with local private businesses to ensure ongoing service, which creates local jobs.

Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP, 70-80% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues.  An expected leveling off in diamond production within the next two decades overshadows long-term prospects.
The government is trying to diversify the economy by fostering entrepreneurship among citizens.  It is providing loans and mentorship to small business owners.  The government is spending heavily on education and is opening the country’s first medical school.

Long-term economic development remains a daunting challenge, inhibited by endemic corruption, limited educational opportunities, high income inequality, and poor job prospects.  More than 50% of the population is less than 25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the impoverished countryside.
Improvements in education are particularly important because of the percentage of youth in Cambodia.  UNICEF works with government partners to strengthen capacities at the national and sub-national levels to deliver inclusive basic education.  UNICEF wants to make sure that not only do more students start school, but more students stay in school.  They have several initiatives to improve education that are making an impact.  UNICEF has unique donation gift packages that tell you exactly where your money is going.  For example, for $30 you can send 8 local language storybooks to a school.

Maternal and child care is very poor and in need of attention.  Micronutrient deficiencies remain widespread. Anaemia is common among children under five, with a prevalence of more than 80% among children under two. It also affects a significant percentage of pregnant women.   Deficiencies can cause blindness and brain damage.
UNICEF works with the Ministry of Health in Cambodia to support improvements in antenatal, delivery and postpartum care, emphasizing the need for skilled birth attendance linked through referral systems to emergency obstetric and newborn care.  UNICEF has unique donation gift packages that tell you exactly where your money is going.  For example, for $30.30 you can send 900 micronutrient packets to enrich the diet of four children for seven and a half months.

Buffeted by the global economic crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. Canada achieved marginal growth in 2010-13 and plans to balance the budget by 2015. In addition, the country's petroleum sector is rapidly expanding, because Alberta's oil sands significantly boosted Canada's proven oil reserves.

Canada's health care system is a group of socialized health insurance plans that provides coverage to all Canadian citizens. It is publicly funded and administered on a provincial or territorial basis, within guidelines set by the federal government.  With a few exceptions, all citizens qualify for health coverage regardless of medical history, personal income, or standard of living.  There are political tensions over the system and some want to privatize it.

The Chinese government faces numerous economic challenges, including: (1) reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic consumption; (2) facilitating higher-wage job opportunities for the aspiring middle class, including rural migrants and increasing numbers of college graduates; (3) reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (4) containing environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's rapid transformation.
Various studies estimate pollution costs the Chinese economy about 7-10% of GDP each year. WWF encourages public support of sustainable energy development through its programs in China.  92% of all money donated to WWF goes directly to delivering conservation results which will help make China’s economy more sustainable and strong for future generations.

One consequence of population control policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table, especially in the North - is another long-term problem.
Respiratory and heart diseases related to air pollution are the leading cause of death in China. While some progress has been achieved in improving energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions reduction, 75% of energy production is still dependent on coal.  The WWF aims to reduce air and water pollution in China.   Through donations, the problem of pollution can be addressed and positive health effects will follow.

At least 80% of Chad's population relies for its livelihood on subsistence farming and livestock raising and oil provides the bulk of export revenues. Chad's investment climate remains challenging due to limited infrastructure, a lack of trained workers, extensive government bureaucracy, and corruption.
One of the things the ONE Foundation, started by U2 musician, Bono, does is that it works to help pass legislation in the US and EU to require better transparency in the oil, gas and mining industries to fight corruption and ensure resources benefit the poorest.  ONE has a program where you can bring fund raising to your campus.  They have a campus leaderboard with the most involved schools and give you resources to start fundraising.

In eastern Chad, the recruitment of children into armed groups remained a critical problem. According to UNICEF database, between 2007 and 2010, 976 children formally associated with armed forces and groups were released and now benefit from prevention, release and reintegration efforts. A number of children remain in armed groups, due to the lack of a formal disarmament demobilization program.
Child Soldiers International works to end the military recruitment of under-18s globally and to prevent their use in armed conflict wherever it occurs. They do this through global monitoring, in-depth work on selected countries, and research and analysis on key issues relating to child soldiers.  A $33 donation pays for a local child rights activist to attend one day of a workshop in Chad or the DR Congo, thereby helping them to better protect children’s rights in armed conflict.

Paramilitary groups in Colombia have members that number in the thousands, and operate in vast areas of Colombia and are responsible for massacres, killings, forced displacement, rape, and extortion, as well as drug trafficking.
Human Rights Watch is working to expose the continued existence of these groups and diminish their influence.  Human Rights Watch's previous reporting and advocacy have contributed to the establishment of human rights conditions on US military aid to Colombia, helped prevent the passage of laws that would have undermined accountability for paramilitaries' accomplices, and led to reforms in the paramilitary demobilization process.  Human Rights Watch depends on donations from average citizens to move forward with their initiatives.

Pervasive sexual violence due to frequent wars has left many women no longer welcome at home and ostracized by their communities.  They have very few resources and are in dire need of help.
Women for Women International has programs in DR Congo that include business and vocational skills, rights awareness and health education classes, and emotional support. Their one-year program was developed for DR Congo's special challenges and demands, and includes vocational training that helps women earn an income and support themselves, through ceramics and bread making.  Monthly donations of $30 sponsor a “sister” through the year-long training program designed to give her skills to support her family.

As of December 2013, conflict had driven nearly three million people from their homes in the DRC, according to United Nations estimates.  Many go into hiding in forest or scrublands, struggling to obtain food and drinking water well beyond the reach of humanitarian organizations and medical care. People wounded by fighting go untreated, and outbreaks of diseases such as malaria, cholera, and measles occur year after year.
Doctors Without Borders projects have reached hundreds of thousands of people who would not have otherwise received medical care.  Often times the displaced are forgotten and do not receive aid.  Doctors Without Borders seeks to give meaningful assistance to the forgotten.  Doctors Without Borders accepts donations and many donors hold fundraisers in order to raise the money they wish to donate.

The USA has been emerging from the global recession.  In late 2013, the Fed announced that it would begin scaling back long-term bond purchases to $75 billion per month in January 2014 and reduce them further as conditions warranted; the Fed, however, would keep short-term rates near zero so long as unemployment and inflation had not crossed the previously stated thresholds. Long-term problems include stagnation of wages for lower-income families, inadequate investment in deteriorating infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, energy shortages, and sizable current account and budget deficits.
There are many organizations that attempt to right socio-economic injustices right here in the USA.  An example is the Salvation Army, with whom donating just $25 provides clothing and school supplies for a child and $100 helps shelter a homeless family for 5 days.

Health care in the United States is provided by many distinct organizations.  Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. 62% of the hospitals are non-profit, 20% are government owned, 18% are for-profit.  60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 67 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured.  On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance.
Organizations like the Red Cross work with those in need of medical attention and disaster relief in the United States and abroad.

Currently the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80% of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the earthquake further inflicted $7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's GDP to contract. In 2011, the Haitian economy began recovering from the earthquake. However, two hurricanes adversely affected agricultural output and the low public capital spending slowed the recovery in 2012.
 The Red Cross is still helping to rebuild Haiti 4 years after the earthquake.  The Haiti earthquake has been a unique disaster response experience even for the Red Cross, due to the magnitude of its impact, the high levels of poverty in Port-au-Prince prior to the earthquake, the urban nature of the quake-affected region, and the ripple effects on Haiti’s political, economic and social fabric.  Donating funds helps to accomplish this cause.

Organizations like Save the Children focus on improving the well being of communities that need help through donations and child sponsorship.  Child sponsorship allows you to make a lasting impact on a child’s life for less than $1 a day.  For $28 per month, you can provide for a child and their family in Haiti.  Save the Children wants donors to form a friendship with their child and will send you letters and pictures from your child that allow you to learn about their world.

GlobeMed is an organization that allows over 1,500 students at over 50 universities to partner with local health clinics in countries that need assistance.  They pair each university-based GlobeMed chapter with a unique organization already improving the health of its community. Year after year, these students and grassroots leaders collaborate on projects that deepen and expand the organization's impact.  For example, at Georgetown University, students work with a rural health clinic called Primeros Pasos in Guatemala that works with health promotion.  If you are passionate about the issue of health equity look into founding a GlobeMed chapter at your campus.

Argentina is facing a financial crisis caused by government politics and unfortunate monetary policy.  The Argentinian peso has lost very much of its value as inflation has grown to 28% last year.  Poorer, rural areas are still underdeveloped.
Argentina is an advanced economy with rich natural resources, a highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.  The main issue it is grappling with is how to control inflation and make it more attractive to invest in its country.  The country’s exchange rate has stabilized since January but its government is still working on recovery through loosening policies and encouraging investment.  Organizations like the Foundation for Sustainable development work in the less developed areas of Argentina and provide assistance to Argentinian entrepreneurs.  The foundation takes interns and allows them to work hands on in the area they are supporting.

Public health care, which covers approximately 50 percent of the population, is funded by the Argentinian government. The Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud) is responsible for public health services, government hospitals and medical services. The running of actual services, however, often takes place at a municipal level, which means that there are different levels of quality within the country.
Although the quality of healthcare varies within the country, the level of healthcare is sufficient, although the system is inefficient, in most areas.  It’s problems are mostly with the public/private system bureaucracy and at a governmental level.

Falling home prices, high consumer debt, and the global economic slowdown compounded Britain's economic problems, pushing the economy into recession in the latter half of 2008 and prompting the government to implement a number of measures to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets.  In 2012, weak consumer spending and subdued business investment weighed on the economy, however, in 2013 GDP grew 1.4%, accelerating unexpectedly in the second half of the year because of greater consumer spending and a recovering housing market. The budget deficit is falling but remains high at nearly 7% and public debt has continued to increase.

Each country provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. In addition, each also has a private healthcare sector which is considerably smaller than its public equivalent, with provision of private healthcare acquired by means of private health insurance, funded as part of an employer funded healthcare scheme or paid directly by the customer, though provision can be restricted for those with conditions such as AIDS/HIV.

The Spanish financial crisis began as part of the world Late-2000s financial crisis and continued as part of the European sovereign debt crisis.  The unemployment rate rose from a low of about 8% in 2007 to more than 26% in 2013, straining Spain's public finances as spending on social benefits increased while tax revenues fell.  Public debt has increased substantially – from 60.1% of GDP in 2010 to 93.4% in 2013. Rising labor productivity, moderating labor costs, and lower inflation have helped to improve foreign investor interest in the economy and to reduce government borrowing costs. The government's ongoing efforts to implement reforms - labor, pension, health, tax, and education - are aimed at supporting investor sentiment.
The Spanish government is working to pass policies to ease the strain on the economy and spur growth.  Improving conditions in the European Union, Spain’s main export market, will further increase growth.  The government took many controversial austerity measures to try to reduce the country’s budget deficit that resulted in tax increases, government spending cuts, and protests.

Spain's single-payer health care system is ranked seventh best in the world by the World Health Organization. The system offers universal coverage as a constitutionally-guaranteed right and no out-of-pocket expenses — aside from prescription drugs. Patients do complain, however, about the long wait to see specialists and undergo certain procedures.  Many health workers were unhappy with and protested the privatization that occurred through austerity measures aimed to boost the economy.

Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession and have remained at about 6% in 2010-13, based on the national measure, about two-thirds average EU unemployment. An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit in 2009, where it remains. In spite of the deficits, the new coalition government delivered a modest stimulus to the economy in 2012. Nonetheless, Denmark's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the EU with public debt at about 46% of GDP in 2013. Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), so far Denmark has decided not to join, although the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro.

Denmark provides "free" health care to all residents, funded through taxes. There is an optional private health care sector, but it is tiny compared with the vastly larger public system that is used by most of the population. Users pay for a few procedures, such as fertility treatments (from the third attempt onwards) and non-essential cosmetic surgery, as well as most of their own dental care and a portion of prescription medication.  Apothecaries are privately owned, but doctors’ visits and hospitalization, including tests, treatment, follow-up care, and some medication, are fully covered.  100% of Danish citizens are covered.

The Greek economy averaged growth of about 4% per year between 2003 and 2007, but the economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure to address a growing budget deficit. By 2013 the economy had contracted 26%, compared with the pre-crisis level of 2007.  Greece has adopted austerity measures to attempt to government spending, decreasing tax evasion, overhauling the health-care and pension systems, and reforming the labor and product markets.  
Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP.  Throughout 2013, Greece's lenders called on Athens to step up efforts to increase tax collection, dismiss public servants, privatize public enterprises, and rein in health spending.  Investor confidence began to show signs of strengthening by the end of 2013 as leading macroeconomic indicators suggested the economy’s freefall had been arrested.

Health care in Greece is provided through national health insurance, although private health care is also an option.  However, since July 2011, with the recent austerity measures, unemployed Greeks receive benefits for a maximum of a year, and after that period, health care is no longer universal and patients must pay for their own treatment.  Austerity measures have also resulted in citizens being forced to contribute more towards the cost of their medications.

Russia's manufacturing sector is generally uncompetitive on world markets and is geared toward domestic consumption. Russia's reliance on commodity exports makes it vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the volatile swings in global prices. The economy, which had averaged 7% growth during 1998-2008 as oil prices rose rapidly, was one of the hardest hit by the 2008-09 global economic crisis as oil prices plummeted and the foreign credits that Russian banks and firms relied on dried up.

In Russia and the former Soviet Union, Tuberculosis has been an acute problem.  Today, the official estimate of the incidence of TB is about 82 to 83 per 100,000 population.  Tuberculosis strains in Russia carry mutations that not only make them resistant to antibiotics but also help them to spread more effectively.
Partners In Health works with the Russian Ministry of Health to combat one of the world’s worst epidemics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.  Key components of their clinical efforts include improving diagnostics in order to detect cases earlier, increasing adherence rates, improving infection control in hospitals and clinics, and decreasing transmission of TB to HIV-positive patients.  The organization takes donations of as little as $25 and guarantees that 93% of the funds go directly to life saving programs.

Malaria is a problem faced by the lower-class people in Pakistan. The unsanitary conditions and stagnant water bodies in the rural areas and city slums provide excellent breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Use of nets and mosquito repellents is becoming more common.  The non-profit, Malaria No More works to distribute mosquito nets and rapid diagnostic tests in countries with a high prevalence of malaria.  They also engage in health education to raise awareness about the disease.  Donations help fund programs, ranging from mobilizing interventions to providing health education to supporting our life-saving work for at-risk families.

Indonesia still struggles with poverty and unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among regions. The government also faces the challenges of quelling labor unrest and reducing fuel subsidies in the face of high oil prices.
Save the Children brings long term and sustainable benefits to more Indonesian children and works to establish effective, self-sustaining approaches to poverty issues.  For $40, a stock of baby fish, along with a fishing pole, fishhooks, lines and fishing net, can be given to a family who can feed themselves and start a business to help them escape poverty.  For $120 you can give two goats and a sheep. Farm animals sustain families by keeping them fed and by providing valuable income. As herds begin to grow, families have even more potential to lift themselves out of poverty.

Major health related issue facing this country:  The maternal mortality rate has stagnated in recent years and has even increased.  Experts blame the increase in the rate on the failure to decrease the fertility rate because of lack of awareness about family planning.

Education funding in the Philippines decreased after the economic crisis of 2008 following the conditions imposed by different funding agencies. Class sizes increased and teachers are teaching more classes per week. School infrastructural development programs and teachers’ salaries have yet to be affected.
The Peace Corps currently has an initiative to build a resource center for youth and adults to have access to reading and resource materials and technology on a regular basis so as to improve literacy in either mother tongue, Filipino, and/or English.  A primary objective of the resource center is to provide for the community learning resources such as books, computer, internet, printing, and weekly and monthly activities such as book readings for children. Donations go directly to this project, which still needs $7762.38 more to be completed.

Major health related issue facing this country: The Philippines’ position as an island country and extensive coastal regions make it very vulnerable to natural disasters, like hurricanes.  Disaster planning needs assistance.
The American Red Cross continues to help families recover and rebuild from Typhoon Haiyan, a storm that tore through the Philippines with record strength winds and high storm surges.  Approximately 16 million people across 40 provinces were affected by the typhoon and more than 1 million homes were destroyed.  Donations go to the Red Cross working side by side with families to rebuild their homes and their livelihoods.

In recent years economic growth has been driven by mining - particularly of iron ore and oil exploration. The country exports rutile, diamonds, and bauxite, and is vulnerable to fluctuations in international commodity prices.  Its conditions in and fighting over its diamond mines are a point of strong contention.  For example, the movie “Blood Diamond” was inspired by the conflicts in Sierra Leone.
Amnesty International is working on promoting changes that require that diamonds be certified “conflict free”.  The retail sector in particular fails to provide sufficient assurance to consumers that the diamonds they sell are conflict-free. They want your help to find out how policies are being communicated at the shop level, and what actions, if any, are being taken to ensure that policies are more than just rhetoric. To help, you can write letters to strengthen enforcement of the Clean Diamond Trade Act, survey jewelers in your area and help to educate consumers.

Major health related issue facing this country:  Sierra Leone’s maternal mortality rate is almost 2 times the African average of 500 deaths/100,000 live births.  They are in desperate need of resources for mothers.  One in eight women risk dying during pregnancy or childbirth. This is one of the highest maternal death rates in the world.  Thousands of women bleed to death after giving birth. Most die in their homes. Some die on the way to hospital, in taxis, on motorbikes, or on foot. In Sierra Leone, less than half of deliveries are attended by a skilled birth attendant and less than one in five are carried out in health facilities.
Political will from the government of Sierra Leone is there to ensure the free health care policy is in place, but there are several issues that still need to be addressed in order for the quality of care to be improved and rates of maternal deaths significantly reduced.  Amnesty International suggests that you read the cases of specific women and write to the government of Sierra Leone, acknowledging their efforts but also calling for wider systematic changes in order to significantly improve the lives of pregnant women in Sierra Leone.

The Rwandan Government is seeking to become regional leader in information and communication technologies. In 2010, Rwanda neared completion of the first modern Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Kigali. The SEZ seeks to attract investment in all sectors, but specifically in agribusiness, information and communications technologies, trade and logistics, mining, and construction.  Although they have made these advancements, there is still a need to get rid of poverty.  
Opportunity International has a bank in Rwanda that practices microfinance.  In Rwanda, women currently outnumber men and are playing a major role in the growing economy.

Major health related issue facing this country:  Around 206,900 people in Rwanda are infected with AIDS.  Many health centers lack essential physical facilities, equipment and supplies. Electricity supply is erratic throughout Rwanda, impacting hospitals, health centers and laboratories. Blood safety, data management and drug storage are all impacted by the erratic electricity supply. While stigma continues to be a problem for people living with HIV/AIDS, it would appear that the situation is slowly improving due to good information sharing at all levels about HIV/AIDS.
The RED Foundation works to stop HIV/AIDS from spreading.  It works with major brands, which agree to donate up to 50% of the proceeds from a particular product to the foundation.  By simply looking for products marked with the RED logo, you can help contribute to the fight against HIV/AIDS.
